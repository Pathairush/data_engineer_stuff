# Data Engineering Nanodegree (Udacity)

Hi everyone, Welcome to my data engineering projects repository. The repository aims to show my data engineering projects that I have done in the data engineering nanodegree program from Udacity. Please feel free to use it as a reference for your project.

# Projects

There will be five projects that used the same data source (`Sparkify`). We tackle the same data source with a different technology such as `PostgreSQL`, `Cassandra`, `AWS Redshift` and `Spark`. With the same data source, we will learn how to apply each data technology to extract, transform and load data. What is the benefit and drawback of each stack?

When we finished learning all the technology, we have a chance to select and apply the knowledge by ourselves in `capstone_project`. In short, we build an end-to-end data pipeline for `I94 Immigration` data. 

The project is open-ended. There will have many features I can improve in the `capstone_project` later after graduating from the nanodegree. Here are something I plan to improve the project in the future.

- [ ] Orchestrator the data pipeline with Apache Airflow
- [ ] Deploy the project in AWS environment with CloudFormation
- [ ] Try to create an end-to-end data pipeline with other data sources (API, JSON)

# What about the Nanodegree?

Disclaimer: I take this course with a 75 % off monthly discount (~ 100 USD). Also, I'm familiar with `python`, `sql`,  and `spark` language before taking this course.

Here is my brief opinion on the data engineering nanodegree. I've been taking this course from 17 Mar 2021 to 14 Apr 2021. What I mean is that you can finish the whole data engineering program within less than a month. The suggested time to complete this course from Udacity is around five months. 

You can fast forward through the material stuff because It can be able to access after graduation to review and refresh your knowledge.

## about the learning experience

The time I spent with the project assignment was valuable. My background in data engineering was near to nothing. I occasionally create or update the table in the database before I am taking this course. It's great to develop and update the data table from the beginning. I think that would be a boring part for other students. I saw some comments in the student forum that it's like a typing practice which I agreed on for some assignments.

The good thing about this Nanodegree is that they provide you with a complete development environment. I can submit the spark script through the terminal without any configuration. This environment is the best thing in this nanodegree program. If you don't understand why it is good, try replicating the Udacity workspace in your local machine. This benefit helps students focus on learning what is important rather than spending time configure the environment.

The project review is another feature I love about this nanodegree. In other MOOC courses, The system usually grades your assignment. But in the nanodegree you have to submit your project, and the mentor will review it. I would say that some mentors give me informative comments with sufficient materials for me to make a further study by myself. This feature helps me learning new things more accessible.

In summary, I recommend anyone who lacks confidence in starting their data engineering journey like me to take this course. It helps boost your confidence and gives you many ideas to do in a further project. Also, You can add your assignments to your portfolio or GitHub to show that you know something about this topic.
